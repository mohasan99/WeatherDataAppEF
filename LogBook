## What I accomplished today
- Set up the project structure according to the assignment requirements:
  Created a solution with three separate projects: Core, DataAccess, and UI.
  Added proper project references between the layers.

- Implemented the core architecture:
  Created the WeatherEntry model with fields for place, date, temperature, and humidity.
  Added the WeatherCalculator service structure in the Core project.

- Installed and configured Entity Framework Core in the DataAccess project, including SQLite.

- Implemented WeatherContext (DbContext) connected to a SQLite database.

- Added CsvImporter and started parsing CSV data.

## What I learned
- How to set up a layered C# solution with clean separation of concerns.
- How EF Core handles database creation and model mapping.
- Importance of understanding CSV column order before parsing.
- How Visual Studio project types affect execution (Class Library vs Console App).

## Next steps
- Finalize CSV import with correct date & number formats.
- Implement calculations (hottest day, coldest day, averages, humidity metrics).
- Build UI menu to let the user select different weather statistics.
- Start working on VG-level requirements once base functionality is stable.

## What I accomplished today
- Implemented average outdoor temperature calculation for any chosen date.
- Added user input and validation in Program.cs to test the feature.
- Created DailyAverageTemp model for storing daily results.
- Implemented sorting of outdoor days from warmest to coldest using average temperature.
- Displayed the sorted list correctly in the console.

## What I learned
- How to use LINQ for filtering, grouping, averaging, and sorting.
- How to design small helper models to structure results cleanly.
- How to separate calculation logic (Core) from UI code (UI project).
- How to reuse loaded data efficiently instead of querying the DB multiple times.

## Next steps
- Implement driest → most humid outdoor days using average humidity.
- Implement mold risk sorting.
- Calculate meteorological Autumn/Winter.
- Build a simple menu system to navigate different statistics.

## What I accomplished today
- Completed all outdoor features:
  - Average outdoor temp for selected date
  - Warmest → coldest days (avg temp)
  - Driest → most humid days (avg humidity)
  - Mold-risk sorting
  - Meteorological autumn + winter calculations

- Completed all indoor features:
  - Average indoor temp for selected date
  - Warmest → coldest indoor days
  - Driest → most humid indoor days
  - Indoor mold-risk sorting

- Improved console output with clean tables for all statistics.

## What I learned
- How to reuse LINQ patterns for filtering, grouping, averaging, and sorting.
- How to apply domain logic (autumn/winter rules, mold index) in code.
